Remember you should

-   add code chunks by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar
    or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I* to answer the questions!
-   **knit** your file to produce a markdown version that you can see!
-   save your work often

## Overview

This practice reviews the [Hypothesis testing starting with binomial
tests lecture](../chapters/Binomial.qmd).

## Hypothesis Testing and the Binomial Distribution

### Example

Using the bat paper from class (Geipel et al. 2021), let's consider how
to analyze data showing all 10 bats chose the walking over the
motionless model.

```{r}
binom.test(10,10)
```

We use the binom.test function. We only need arguments for \# of
succeses and \# of trials. By default it runs a 2-sided test against a
null hypothesis value of p = .5. You can see how to update thee options
by looking at the help file.

```{r, eval=F}
?binom.test
```

Note the confidence interval is assymetric since its estimated to be 1!
We can see other options using the binom.confint function from the
*binom* package.

```{r}
library(binom)
binom.confint(10,10)
```

All of these correct for the fact that most intervals use a normal
approximation, which as you remember from our earlier discussions is not
good when sample sizes are small and/or the p parameter is extreme
(close to 0 or 1).

## Practice!

Make sure you are comfortable with null and alternative hypotheses for
all examples.

### 1

Are people eared (do they prefer one ear or another)? Of 25 people
observed while in conversation in a nightclub, 19 turned their right ear
to the speaker and 6 turn their left ear to the speaker. How strong is
the evidence for eared-ness given this data (adapted from Analysis of
Biological Data)? \* state a null and alternative hypothesis \*
calculate a test statistic (signal) for this data \* Make you understand
how to construct a null distribution + using sampling/simulation (code
or written explanation) + by using an appropriate distribution (code or
written explanation) \* Calculate and compare p-values obtained using +
simulation (calculation won’t be required on test, but make sure you
understand!) (code or written explanation) + equations for binomial
distribution (code or written explanation) + R functions
(required)(code) \* Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the
proportion of people who are right-eared \* How do your 95% confidence
interval and hypothesis test compare?
```{r}
sampling_experiment = rbinom(10000, 25, .5)
hist(sampling_experiment, breaks = 0:25, xlab = "# of Right-eared people out of 25", ylab = "Probability of being drawn \n from population of p = 0.5", cex.main = 2, cex.axis = 1.5, cex.lab = 2)
```
```{r}
using_distribution = dbinom(0:25,25,.5)
using_distribution
sum(using_distribution)
Number_righteared = c(0:25)
pdf = data.frame(Number_righteared, using_distribution)
plot(0:25, using_distribution)
```
```{r}
library(binom)
binom.confint(x=19, n=25, alpha=.05, method="all") #use Agresti-coull 
#or
binom.confint(x=19, n=25, alpha=.05, method="agresti-coull")library(binom)
binom.confint(x=19, n=25, alpha=.05, method="all") #use Agresti-coull 
#or
binom.confint(x=19, n=25, alpha=.05, method="agresti-coull")
```


### 2

A professor lets his dog take every multiple-choice test to see how it
compares to his students (I know someone who did this). Unfortunately,
the professor believes undergraduates in the class tricked him by
helping the dog do better on a test. It’s a 100 question test, and every
questions has 4 answer choices. For the last test, the dog picked 33
questions correctly. How likely is this to happen, and is there evidence
the students helped the dog?

```{r}
#use sided test as you only care if students helped the dog
binom.test(33,100, alternative="greater", p=.25)
```


**MAKE SURE TO THINK ABOUT YOUR TEST OPTIONS**
